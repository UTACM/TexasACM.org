New models, architectures, languages, and veri?cation techniques are therefore necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software devel- ment. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behavior from communication and therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. This volume contains the proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (Coordination 2005), held at the Ins- tute of Informatics of the University of Namur, Belgium, on April 20-23, 2005. The previous conferences in this series took place in Cesena (Italy), Berlin (G- many),Amsterdam(TheNetherlands),Limassol(Cyprus),York(UK),andPisa (Italy). Building upon the success of these events, Coordination 2005 provided a forum for the community of researchers interested in models, languages, and implementation techniques for coordination and component-based software, as well as applications that exploit them. The conference attracted 88 submissions from authors all over the world.</p></div><!-- End description for Coordination Models and Languages: 7th International Conference, COORDINATION 2005, Namur, Belgium, April 20-23, 2005, Proceedings --></div><div class="medium" id="medium6F621585-6C34-46EC-9728-45E29F205E63"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0201634422"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6F621585-6C34-46EC-9728-45E29F205E63-256.png" width="211" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201634422?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">An Engineering Approach to Computer Networking: ATM Networks, the Internet, and the Telephone Network</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Srinivasan%20Keshav&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Srinivasan Keshav  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>This text provides an introduction to the inner workings of computer networks, employing an engineering approach that should help readers gain a grasp of not just how, but also why, networks work the way they do.

It also uses the Internet as the main example of networks. This all creates a book relevant to those interested in networking today. By starting at the application-layer and working down the protocol stack, this book provides a relevant introduction of important concepts. Based on the rationale that once a reader understands the applications of networks they can understand the network services needed to support these applications, this book takes a "top-down" approach that exposes readers first to a concrete application and then draws into some of the deeper issues surrounding networking. This book focuses on the Internet as opposed to addressing it as one of many computer network technologies, further motivating the study of the material. This book is designed for programmers who need to learn the fundamentals of computer networking.

C++ in a Nutshell lives up to the In a Nutshell promise. C++ in a Nutshell is a lean, focused reference that offers practical examples for the most important, most often used, aspects of C++.C++ in a Nutshell packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills.The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order, for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers.When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax or parameters required by library routines quickly. What, for example, is the C++ syntax to define an alias for a namespace? Just how do you create and use an iterator to work with the contents of a standard library container? C++ in a Nutshell is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.</p></div><!-- End description for C++ in a Nutshell --></div><div class="medium" id="medium22CFD4AB-48FE-406C-AD3F-6CBACA0D760F"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1565924533"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/22CFD4AB-48FE-406C-AD3F-6CBACA0D760F-256.png" width="197" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565924533?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Mastering Algorithms with C: Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kyle%20Loudon&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kyle Loudon  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions.

He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth.<br><br>Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book.

The book has two equally significant goals. One goal is to help students develop mathematical thinking skills, particularly, theorem-proving skills. The other goal is to help students understand some of the wonderfully rich ideas in the mathematical study of numbers. This book is appropriate for a proof transitions course, for an independent study experience, or for a course designed as an introduction to abstract mathematics. Math or related majors, future teachers, and students or adults interested in exploring mathematical ideas on their own will enjoy ;Number Theory Through Inquiry.; Number theory is the perfect topic for an introduction-to-proofs course. Every college student is familiar with basic properties of numbers, and yet the exploration of those familiar numbers leads us to a rich landscape of ideas. Number Theory Through Inquiry contains a carefully arranged sequence of challenges that lead students to discover ideas about numbers and to discover methods of proof on their own. It is designed to be used with an instructional technique variously called guided discovery or Modified Moore Method or Inquiry Based Learning (IBL). Instructors materials explain the instructional method. This style of instruction gives students a totally different experience compared to a standard lecture course. Here is the effect of this experience: Students learn to think independently: they learn to depend on their own reasoning to determine right from wrong; and theydevelop the central, important ideas of introductory number theory on their own. From that experience, they learn that they can personally create important ideas. They develop an attitude of personal reliance and a sense that they can think effectively about difficult problems. These goals are fundamental to the educational enterprise within and beyond mathematics.</p></div><!-- End description for Number Theory Through Inquiry --></div><div class="medium" id="medium599FCC85-AD22-46D4-9396-BCBF28B1D8EA"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0071613749"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/599FCC85-AD22-46D4-9396-BCBF28B1D8EA-256.png" width="205" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071613749?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets and Solutions, Sixth Edition</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stuart%20McClure%0AJoel%20Scambray%0AGeorge%20Kurtz&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The world's bestselling computer security book—fully expanded and updated<br><br>"Right now you hold in your hand one of the most successful security books ever written.
