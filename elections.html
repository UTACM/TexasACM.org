						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Social</li>
								<li>Marketing</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						I have been the social/marketing operational officer for the past year and worked directly with the social/marketing senior officer. Throughout this year, I've sent out weekly newsletters, made social media posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Discord, and attended most of the ACM events. I've also consistently spent time in the office.

						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Corporate</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						I believe my time spent this year as ACM's Corporate Operational Officer has prepared me to become a successful Corporate SO next year. During this year, I gained a lot of valuable experience in ACM corporate duties, such as recruiting sponsors and working together with ACM's current sponsors to organize corporate events. Additionally, I also got to know the rest of ACM's officer team quite well and have enjoyed becoming a more active member in ACM. I think that becoming Corporate SO is a great way for me to continue my involvement in ACM, and I hope I have your support.

						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Academics</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						Experiencing failure is a big part of learning, and I'm not hesitant to admit that I've encountered obstacles as a UTCS student that I've initially failed to summit. Nevertheless, as the saying goes "failure is the best teacher." By learning from my mistakes and growing beyond them, I believe I have gained the experience and strength of character to convey my thoughts to others in order to foster success in those around me. Furthermore, I hope to redirect my teaching experience as an Academics OO into my responsibilities as the SO for Academics, which will hopefully help others discover new CS interests and fortify their existing talents.

					<h3 class="officerPosition" onClick="unhidePosition(internal_candidates)">Sairaja (Sai) Kurelli </h3>

						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Finance</li>
								<li>Webmaster</li>
								<li>President</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						Hi
						I think I would be a good Finance office since I like organizing and picking fun items for our PR.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h3 class="officerPosition" onClick="unhidePosition(academics_candidates)">Vincent Cacciatore & Michelle Sanchez</h3>
					<!-- <div id="academics_candidates" class="hidePosition"></div> -->
					<p>
						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>President</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						ACM has been a tremendous source of community and support during my time at UTCS, and I want to continue that for future generations of students. However, we can always find ways to improve the organization. Some specific items are:
						<ul>
							<li>Strengthening relationships with local sponsor</li>
							<li>Promote more programming related to academic careers</li>
							<li>Work closely with ACM4Change to engage students in conversations about ethics in CS</li>
							<li>Use member feedback to make events</li>
							<li>increase community engagement</li>
							<li>more opportunities for students to build academic and social relationships across classes</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br />
					<h3 class="officerPosition" onClick="unhidePosition(finance_candidates)">Joshua Clark</h3>
					<!-- <div id="finance_candidates" class="hidePosition"></div> -->
					<p>
						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Finance</li>
								<li>Internal</li>
								<li>Academics</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						I'm Josh, and if you've been to a couple of events you've probably seen me before. I make an effort to show up to every event and make them as top notch as possible. I'm currently the Finance OO and have experience with a lot of the duties that come with being Finance SO. With being OO and UT Racquetball Treasurer, I have a lot of recent experience as a college club officer, especially finance. This should make me an excellent officer.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h3 class="officerPosition" onClick="unhidePosition(social_candidates)">Macy Huang</h3>
					<!-- <div id="social_candidates" class="hidePosition"></div> -->
					<p>
						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Human Resources</li>
								<li>Corporate</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						This year, I served as HR Senior Officer and I feel that it gave me a lot of insight into what makes events successful -- clear advertisement, a sense of purpose, and the proper incentives (food). I attended almost every ACM event this semester, and what you should take from that is not that I will do anything I can to postpone working on OS (this was a bit of a factor though), but that I have dedicated myself as an officer to making sure events run smoothly, whether that means offering feedback in biweekly officer meetings, talking to new people during events, or helping out behind the scenes to make sure everything is in place. Next year, I hope to continue to do the same while offering more ways for ACM members to Associate with each other, in Computing and non-computing related ways MMMM(achinery). This would include our existing mentorship program, but also initiatives I'd like to start, like club Brown Bags, so club members can meet new people on a one-on-one basis. What I've found most valuable about ACM in my time as a member over the last two years isn't the communal Nintendo Switch, microwave, nor the fridge in the office, but the really cool people within it, and as your HR Officer next year, I would love to highlight that and do what I can to integrate more people into the fold.
