						The ACM website, just like the organization itself, has been a valuable component to the social and academic 
						development of UTCS and its members. And having gained great experiences through the array learning opportunities 
						from Texas ACM and other organizations, I decide to pay forward by making the web presence of Texas ACM even stronger. 
						Some items I have on thought: <br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>- Enhancing the "AtoZ's" of UTCS, a great resource that can benefit from easier navigation and more effective organization.</li>
							<li>- More information about the sponsors! They are lovely businesses that people would like to learn more about.</li>
							<li>- Supporting the mentorship program by building an internal system for keeping track of meetings, topics, and anything else important. This system will make the mentorship program more tangible and easier to manage to its mentors and mentees.</li>
						</ul>
						And of course, I am open to suggestions and ideas! Regardless of what my calling for ACM and UTCS in general is, I will be doing what I can to better the community.

								<li>President</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						As your HR and Finance SOs this year and common office hanger-outers, Sai and I have fully mastered the art of being at the scene 
						of the crime when unexpected things happen to ACM. We joined ACM at the same time as OOs during the COVID year, so we have a special 
						traumatic bond called profound-dedication-to-seeing-ACM-suceed. Michelle and Vincent have done an excellent job at establishing three 
						central goals for ACM, and over the next year, we want to work on continuing to expand our student support in these areas of classes, 
						community, and career while keeping our door open to every student in UT CS. We have goals that include strengthening our relationship 
						with UT CS professors, building a presence in local Austin open-source and start-up cultures, and bringing more engaging events to you 
						in pursuit of developing a real UT CS community, an anchor and a collaborative space. We welcome the feedback you have toward that end 
						and will work hard to bring it to life over the next school year. Thank you for your support!
					</p>

						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						This year, I've had the privilege of being the Social/Marketing Operational Officer (OO). As the Social/Marketing SO, I plan to 
						expand my role in directed marketing and grow our channels to new sectors of UT students. As OO, I organized and launched a multi-stage 
						social media campaign over Winter Break to help break the ice on what ACM offers to new students, while posting weekly about events 
						through Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Facebook, and our newsletter. I wish to make more event recaps, share pictures/videos, and create 
						quizzes/fun content for students to regularly interact with ACM. For a larger goal, I want to bridge the gap between members and officers 
						by enabling ways to directly suggest ideas for events and shape how members want ACM to look like. Ultimately, through attending kickoffs, 
						CS 101s, thanksgiving dinners, and many more, I have been surrounded by the most compassionate, wacky, and humble people through ACM. ACM 
						has this inimitable synergy, where diverse (and sometimes sleep-deprived) UTCS students come together to help each other with school, careers, 
						or anything else, all while cooking up mischief in the ACM office. Simply put, I want to help people be embraced by all that ACM has to offer, 
						just like I was.

						<b>Running For:</b>
						<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Corporate</li>
								<li>Finance</li>
							</ol>
						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						As ACM corporate officer, I plan to continue my track record of bringing numerous new sponsors to ACM and running unique events 
						that take advantage of our spot in Austin's tech ecosystem. Over the past year, I started two new sponsored event series: LiveOak 
						connections and Hack Night with Z Fellows. I've brought in 3 new sponsors, increased revenue per sponsor by revamping our sponsorship 
						tiers and marketing, and connected ACM with numerous local startups. I believe great corporate events create unique events for 
						students: companies want to send their engineers to participate in hackathons with our community, investors want first preference if 
						you're starting a startup, and many consumer-focused organizations like Cruise/BeReal seek to expand their customer base by offering 
						free trials and perks to student orgs. As corporate officer, I'd help ACM participate in these conversations and design events that 
						improve the student experience and help ACM fund its activities. I have a track record of bringing in great sponsors to ACM and would 
						love to continue this in the upcoming academic year. As well, I've been significantly involved in the effort to represent CS organizations 
						so that the org offices remain a common resource. A primary goal of my term will be to strength inter-org collaboration and improve 
						our relationship with the CS department and CNS.

						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						I am running for ACM Treasurer. If elected, I plan to improve ACM Finance by taking a more critical approach to event 
						budgeting such that our more important events get the supplies they need to shine. Furthermore I plan to continue to build 
						upon the ACM soda initiative to increase the utility of ACM’s budget and make reimbursements a more feasible option. I believe 
						my experience over the past year as the ACM Finance SO puts me in the perfect position to push these initiatives as it has 
						given me the insight into both departmental protocol and event dynamics to make effective and informed decisions.

						Hi everyone! If you ever wonder where all of the ACM food comes from, I'm your answer! As this year's senior Internal officer, 
						I've been responsible for making sure that all the food gets to all of the events all the time. This coming year, while I'd
						love to continue serving in my current role, I believe my skills could be applied in the Human Resources position. As someone 
						who is often on the receiving end of dealing with HR, I'd love a chance to get to be HR and make *other* people's lives 
						miserable! (jk jk) In all seriousness, ACM is a growing organization, and every semester we host more and more events for 
						more and more people. We need effective staff and organization to continue to pull all of this off, and I believe I can make 
						that happen as yOUR Senior HR Officer.

						<b>Platform:</b>
						<br>
						I’ve been attending a majority of ACM events this year and I’d love to get more involved!  I think I would make a 
						good internal officer, as I have experience doing similar work at other clubs at UT and through high school.  I am also 
						very detail-oriented and enjoy keeping records, cleaning, and organizing.  I keep a bullet journal, which is like a planner 
						on steroids, and a regularly updated Google Calendar which helps me stay ahead of work.  I have strong communication 
						skills and am comfortable interacting with people, as I have experience doing demo work for tech companies and my robotics 
						lab.  Internal Affairs plays to my strengths and would be a great way to further contribute to ACM.

						Hey! My name is Nidhi and I am running for Senior Corporate Officer! This year I've served as one of the 
						Corporate Operational Officers and I would love to continue my involvement in ACM. I've worked hard with our current 
						team of officers and to help bring events to students, and as a Corporate SO I would continue supporting ACM by being 
						the point of contact to foster more connections and opportunities to all of our members. Outside of ACM I've also worked 
						as a student officer for my high school organizations such as Student Council and Girls Who Code, and along with the 
						current outreach and organization I help with as a Corporate OO, I've also gained similar experience through those 
						positions. I would love to have your support to continue making corporate the greatest it can be with ACM!

						<br>
						Hello everyone!  I think I would be a great ACM officer even though I was not an OO because of my experience as the 
						social officer (that did a lot of financial things) of Q++ and being a friend of the ACM office. As friend of the office 
						I helped out a bit at events this past semester, but especially got to know the officer team really well, then being an officer 
						of a different UTCS org, I am familiar with a lot of the procedures such as booking a room, submitting PRs, and bugging Carmen 
						in her office. I'd love to have a more official role in the org, no matter what it is. <3 your friend Caterina

						ACM is a wonderful club providing food and fun for everyone in computer science. I would love to give back to this club by serving as an officer. I already have experience introducing new CS majors to UT as a TA for 314, and I would love to introduce new students to ACM.

						Hello! I'm Yuvraj Sahu, and I am primarily running for the position of Academics SO. This past year, I have served as the Academics Operational Officer. You might recognize me from the lectures on Git, SSH, and Linux. You may also be familiar with my signature style of presenting - informal and humorous, yet informative. My previous experiences with teaching, such as three years with high school CS clubs, have allowed me to develop my style and make presentations more interesting and engaging.

If elected as the Academics SO, I will look into opportunities for expanding the curriculum. Currently, it focuses on certain specific topics, including Linux. However, there is room to expand to other topics, such as data structures, algorithms, or systems. I hope to work with y’all and figure out topics to make these lectures more useful to you.

Here’s to a great year together!
