							</br>
							<b>Q: What is it like to hire at UT CS?</b>
							<ol>
								<li>UT Austin is proud to have a Top 10 CS program nationwide. We have strong students who are passionate about what they do.</li>
								
								<li>Disproportionally high impact for our size (500+ students per graduation year), and the small size creates a strongly connected student and alumni community.</li>
								
								<li><b>A unique, strong systems track as part of the core curriculum</b>: by sophomore year, all computer science students take computer architecture and operating systems in which they do the following:<br />
								
								- The System Emulator project where students implement a complete processor pipeline, including hazard controls, forwarding, and caching<br />
								- Building common components from scratch in operating systems such as memory allocators, virtual memory management, file systems, and threading APIs</li>
							</ol>
							<b>Q: What are the demographics of your community?</b>
							<ol>
								<li>About 80% of our community are CS majors, but we maintain an open-door approach to events and attract students from across the university (everyone from economics to engineering to MIS to Liberal Arts).</li>
								
								<li>Our community is split evenly by class year, about 20% freshmen, 25% sophomores, 30% juniors, 20% seniors, 5% grad students.</li>
								
								<li>We have a reputation for holding high-value events and initiatives that students love. We make a point of being inclusive and welcoming at all events, and marketing across a variety of channels (not just CS!)</li>
							</ol>
							<b>Q: What are some examples of previous sponsor relationships?</b>
							<ol>
								<li>An AMA series with a local venture capital fund<br />
									- Brought founders and technical leaders to campus, <b>reaching 100+ attendees</b><br />
									- Created </b>significant brand awareness</b> for the fund<br />
									- informal networking led to <b>recruiting opportunities</b> for their portfolio companies<br />
								</li>	
								<li>We hosted a tech talk featuring a CTO and engineers from a local startup, which resulted in new hires and strong brand awareness for a B2B SaaS company. Attendees even plastered their laptops with branded stickers, and their logo hats around campus has become a common sight.</li>
								<li>We helped the marketing efforts of a new ride-sharing app to our community. Their launch promotion included a week of free rides. In two weeks, we drove over 210 sign ups to their app and 106 first time rides.</li>

								<li>We initiated a series of "Hack Nights" with a student-focused startup investor. During these events, students would start projects in a single night. <br />
									- One project </b>gained significant attention</b> and was featured on the front page of Hacker News<br />
									- Student-made startups went on to </b>acquire funding</b> from said investor<br />
								</li>
