But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible.</p></div><!-- End description for Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 3rd Updated Edition --><span class="asin">0321287134</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumF7F08500-F337-41A4-8C9F-16848D6E5535"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('F7F08500-F337-41A4-8C9F-16848D6E5535');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F7F08500-F337-41A4-8C9F-16848D6E5535-256.png" width="165" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/006363953X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Solutions manual to accompany The calculus, with analytic geometry, 3d ed., by Louis Leithold</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Louis%20Leithold&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Louis Leithold  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p></p></div><!-- End description for Solutions manual to accompany The calculus, with analytic geometry, 3d ed., by Louis Leithold --><span class="asin">006363953X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium19BB5A4B-119B-4218-966A-53E9F5148DE9"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('19BB5A4B-119B-4218-966A-53E9F5148DE9');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/19BB5A4B-119B-4218-966A-53E9F5148DE9-256.png" width="168" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070375151?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Fault Tolerant System Design</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Shem-Tov%20Levi%0AAshok%20K.%20Agrawala&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Shem-Tov Levi, Ashok K.

The In a Nutshell books have earned a solid reputation in the field as the well-thumbed references that sit beside the knowledgeable developer's keyboard. C++ in a Nutshell lives up to the In a Nutshell promise. C++ in a Nutshell is a lean, focused reference that offers practical examples for the most important, most often used, aspects of C++.C++ in a Nutshell packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills.The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order, for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers.When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax or parameters required by library routines quickly. What, for example, is the C++ syntax to define an alias for a namespace? Just how do you create and use an iterator to work with the contents of a standard library container? C++ in a Nutshell is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.</p></div><!-- End description for C++ in a Nutshell --><span class="asin">059600298X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium22CFD4AB-48FE-406C-AD3F-6CBACA0D760F"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('22CFD4AB-48FE-406C-AD3F-6CBACA0D760F');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/22CFD4AB-48FE-406C-AD3F-6CBACA0D760F-256.png" width="197" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565924533?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Mastering Algorithms with C: Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kyle%20Loudon&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kyle Loudon  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions. Mastering Algorithms with C offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques.<br><br>Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included.<br><br>Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth.<br><br>Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate.

The book has two equally significant goals. One goal is to help students develop mathematical thinking skills, particularly, theorem-proving skills. The other goal is to help students understand some of the wonderfully rich ideas in the mathematical study of numbers. This book is appropriate for a proof transitions course, for an independent study experience, or for a course designed as an introduction to abstract mathematics. Math or related majors, future teachers, and students or adults interested in exploring mathematical ideas on their own will enjoy ;Number Theory Through Inquiry.; Number theory is the perfect topic for an introduction-to-proofs course. Every college student is familiar with basic properties of numbers, and yet the exploration of those familiar numbers leads us to a rich landscape of ideas. Number Theory Through Inquiry contains a carefully arranged sequence of challenges that lead students to discover ideas about numbers and to discover methods of proof on their own. It is designed to be used with an instructional technique variously called guided discovery or Modified Moore Method or Inquiry Based Learning (IBL). Instructors materials explain the instructional method. This style of instruction gives students a totally different experience compared to a standard lecture course. Here is the effect of this experience: Students learn to think independently: they learn to depend on their own reasoning to determine right from wrong; and theydevelop the central, important ideas of introductory number theory on their own. From that experience, they learn that they can personally create important ideas. They develop an attitude of personal reliance and a sense that they can think effectively about difficult problems. These goals are fundamental to the educational enterprise within and beyond mathematics.</p></div><!-- End description for Number Theory Through Inquiry --><span class="asin">0883857510</span></div></td><td><div class="medium" id="medium599FCC85-AD22-46D4-9396-BCBF28B1D8EA"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('599FCC85-AD22-46D4-9396-BCBF28B1D8EA');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/599FCC85-AD22-46D4-9396-BCBF28B1D8EA-256.png" width="205" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071613749?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets and Solutions, Sixth Edition</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stuart%20McClure%0AJoel%20Scambray%0AGeorge%20Kurtz&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The world's bestselling computer security book—fully expanded and updated<br><br>"Right now you hold in your hand one of the most successful security books ever written.

It follows four VDM Europe Symposia, four other Formal Methods Europe S- posia, and the 1999 World Congress on Formal Methods in the Development of Computing Systems. These meetings have been notably successful in bringing - gether a community of users, researchers, and developers of precise mathematical methods for software development. FME 2001 took place in Berlin, Germany and was organized by the C- puter Science Department of the Humboldt-Universit¨at zu Berlin. The theme of the symposium was Formal Methods for Increasing Software Productivity. This theme recognizes that formal methods have the potential to do more for industrial software development than enhance software quality { they can also increase productivity at many di erent points in the software life-cycle. The importance of the theme is borne out by the many contributed papers showing how formal methods can make software development more e cient. There is an emphasis on tools that nd errors automatically, or with relatively little human e ort. There is also an emphasis on the use of formal methods to assist with critical, labor-intensive tasks such as program design and test-case generation.</p></div><!-- End description for FME 2001: Formal Methods for Increasing Software Productivity: International Symposium of Formal Methods Europe, Berlin, Germany, March 12-16, 2001, Proceedings --><span class="asin">3540417915</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB135D266-77D2-409A-A798-4D68367ADBA1"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('B135D266-77D2-409A-A798-4D68367ADBA1');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B135D266-77D2-409A-A798-4D68367ADBA1-256.png" width="208" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/020151379X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Operating System Concepts</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=James%20L.%20Peterson%0AAbraham%20Silberschatz%0APeter%20B.%20Galvin&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">James L.
